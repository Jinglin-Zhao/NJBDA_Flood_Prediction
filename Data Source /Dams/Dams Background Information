Dams are man-made structures built across rivers or streams to store water, control its flow, and generate hydroelectric power. Dams are designed to impound water, creating reservoirs that can be used for various purposes, including irrigation, water supply for communities, flood control, and recreational activities such as boating and fishing. They play a crucial role in managing water resources and providing renewable energy. Dams can vary in size and type, including concrete or earth-filled dams, and their construction involves careful engineering and environmental considerations to ensure their safety and minimize ecological impacts on surrounding ecosystems.
